1st step was to allow Az to create a new key pair...didn't realize you had to convert the *.PIM private key file that Azure creates to a ppk file to use with putty!
After conversion, it worked like a charm!

Used PuttyGen to create a public key by moving the mouse around the screen.  Copy the key and paste into Az Portal at build time of the VM.
Save private key from PuttyGen to a location on the local HD.  Can pwd protect.
Close PuttyGen
Open Putty

Import private key into

After VM is fully created, go to resource and copy the public IP address.
Type azureuser@publicIPaddress in host field

When attempting to connect you will see a PuTTY security alert related to the host key... if this is super secret please compare the fingerprint on the file.
